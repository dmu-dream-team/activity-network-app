## Pitch Manuscript

### Experience Jury
- We've learnt through reasearch papers that the major reason of digital outsidership for seniors is due to lacking human connections in their life.
- To help meet new people, in contrast to social networks who let you meet people you already know, we've built a SMS based event creation service for seniors.
- We choose SMS due to the low technical barrier to entry.
- Most people have a phone.
- In the future we plan in the future to also support voice recognition.
- We have yet to validate that our target group would be comfortable with getting a blind date setup over SMS.
- Once a blind date is spawned the staff will book the restaurant and invites will be sent to participants.
- To kickstart the development we plan to seek funding through EU Regional Development fund.
- We plan to become economically sustainable through partnerships with restaurants who will revshare with us to get people to their business.
- We plan to market through mobile phone providers invoices and the seniors organization(PRO).

- A separate python service is used for interest and geo-based K-means clustering with a Jaccard-similarity measure based on normalized entity-distance values.
